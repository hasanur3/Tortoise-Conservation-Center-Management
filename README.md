Tortoise Conservation Center Management System

Focus: Manage and monitor various aspects of a tortoise conservation center, including
species information, enclosures, breeding activities, feeding schedules, health records,
environmental conditions, and staff assignments.

a. Maintain detailed records for each individual tortoise, including identification numbers,
species classification, age, gender, health status, and history of care.

b. Track information about different enclosures, such as size, habitat type, current
occupants, maintenance schedules, and environmental parameters specific to each
habitat.

c. Manage breeding programs by recording mating pairs, nesting dates, egg counts,
incubation periods, hatching success rates, and related observations.

d. Schedule and log feeding times, monitor dietary requirements for different species or
individuals, and track food inventory levels to ensure proper nutrition management.

e. Document health assessments, medical treatments, vaccination records, and any
incidents of illness or injury, facilitating ongoing health monitoring and care planning.

f. Monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, water quality, etc.
within enclosures and incubators, ensuring optimal conditions.

g. Assign tasks to staff members, track completion status, and manage schedules for
routine activities like feeding, cleaning, medical check-ups, and habitat maintenance.
